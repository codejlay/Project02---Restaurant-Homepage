Project 2 - Restaurant Homepage

Description & Requirement:

For Project 2, you’re going to create a one-page, responsive website for your client 100 Mile Resto Bar.

Your project must:
Make appropriate use of classes and IDs as selectors
Use a CSS reset
Use the background property where appropriate
Use the float property effectively
Demonstrate effective use of box model properties
Demonstrate effective use of CSS properties for altering the visual display of text (e.g. font-family, font-style, text-transform, etc.)
Incorporate custom fonts using @font-face
Use an icon font
Use CSS3 properties where appropriate (e.g. opacity or rgba colour)
Use a pseudo-element to incorporate hover states for the links
JS requirements:

Your project must:
Dynamically display whether the restaurant is open or not (based on the day of the week—the restaurant is closed on Saturday and Sunday)
Incorporate “smooth scrolling” into the menu that navigates to specific points in the page
Incorporate an image slider using a jQuery plugin (bxSlider is a good choice)

Your project must:
Be responsively designed using a mobile-first approach
Be optimized for 3 screen sizes: mobile, min-width: 768px, and min-width: 1280px

Stretch goals:
Add a datepicker to the date form field and timepicker to the time field (and style it according to the client’s brand)

Experience gained:
Having more experience with both floats and Clearfix, floating elements wasn’t as tough this time around. This project also taught me how to use Javascript to add a real-time Business Hours and installing plugins like bxSlider, date and time picker. Smooth scrolling within the page was also a cool thing learned.
